This project is a simple traveling website designed using the client/server architecture. The website allows users to explore various travel destinations, manage a "Want-to-Go" list, and search for destinations based on their preferences. Built using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and EJS, the application provides a seamless user experience with essential features like user registration, login, search functionality, and session management.

The project was deployed on Heroku, making it accessible online for real-world usage.
